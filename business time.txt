oooh yeah
girl tonight we're gonna make love
you know how i know?
because it's pregnancy day
and pregnancy day night is the night
we always make love
all those other nights, we make love too
but pregnancy day night is my night to coom
because pregnancy day we make cyclical reproductive love
it's when everything is just right
there's a ripe egg or eggs in your ovaries
just waiting to burst
so you're hella horny, oh boy...it's all on
you lean in and whisper something sexy in my ear like
uhhhh uh uhhhhhu hhuhuh hhhuh hh huuuhhhhh 
i know what you're trying to say, girl
you're trying to say oh, yeah, it's business time
it's business time

It's business, it's business time
that's what you're trying to say
You're trying to say it's time for business
It's business time, ooh
It's business, it's business time
oooh

next thing you know we're in the sauna, smahging our feet
that's all part of the foreplay...i love foreplay
then you go sort out the kitties 
and their associated intel networks
that isn't part of the foreplay process
but it is still very important

then we're in the bedroom
and you're wearing that ugly old baggy thomper
from that album you did for that old label 
that nobody cares about anymore
and it has never looked better on you
mmmmmmmmmm, teeny whore label album baggy thomper
oh you don't know what you're doing to me
i remove my basketball shorts but trip over them 
cuz i still got my crocs on
but then i turn it into a sexy dance

next thing you know and i'm down to just this song
and you know when i'm down to just this song
you know what time it is
it's time for business...it's business time
it's business, it's business time
you know when i'm down to just this song it's time for business
that's why they call it business time
it's business, it's business time

ohh, ohh making love, making love for 2
making love for 2 teams 
of backup for tay
the jv team backs up the ash team
she probably needs more backup
but it's okay i'm quite sleepy
it's business, it's business time
no, no, no that doesn't mean you're done biatch
it's business, it's business time
