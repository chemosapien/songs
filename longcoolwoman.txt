friday night i was underground
working for my CIA
sitting in a glowing rats nest
writing the gov'ts next lie
gun running cartel on the west side
sex slave army in the subway
just about to call down the rain man
when i heard this woman's sweet sound
a trio of kitties curled out to me
and then tay started to play
she was a long cool woman ina white dress
eleven outta 10
would play again
with just one kiss i was breathless
cuz that long cool woman had it all

Like to tell ya about my baby
You know she comes around
She about five feet ten
from her head to the ground
You know she comes around here
At just about midnight
She make ya feel so good, Lord
She make you feel alright
And her name is T A Y L O-o-o-o-o-o-o
T A Y L O R (tayl--or)
T A Y L O R (tayl--or)
I'm gonna shout it all night (tayl--or)  
gonna shout it all day (tayl--or)
T A Y L O R-rrrrrr
T A Y L O R-rrrrrr
T A Y L O R-rrrrrr (taylor)
