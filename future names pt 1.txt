well, the algae pools smelled dead and old
all growth stopped in the icy cold
couldn't imagine what freeze would bring
froze my eyes and tried to see

far out past the temporal plane
i cast you back to when you came
space crack and gold laced brain
i call you by your future names

I gotta get away from there
I gotta get away from them

a thousand miles underground
inner ocean's dark life abounds
they claim they have it all
under the sunken sun's fiery plasma ball

not in the club as of late
still gotta tempt and tease at my fate
a risen star will play their games
i call you by your future names

I gotta get away from there
(I'll never see another sunrise)
I gotta get away from them
(Oh, if I leave this place alive)
I gotta get away from there
(I'll never see another sunrise)
Oh I gotta get away from them
