I am president Xi Xinping
My honey drips and is never brown
Pooh is forever there
Western power will soon go away
I own the hundred acre woods today
I will cuddle all of you
Your piglets will squeal in school
Your piglets will squeal in school
Hunan Uber Alles
Hunan Uber Alles
Uber Alles Hunan
Uber Alles Hunan
Tigger an eyore will control you
Hundred acre woods
You will smile out at the human race
And always wearing an emoji face
Open your eyes, already happened here
Xinnie the Pooh on white horse is near
The Jesus pig didn't make it back, they say
Fatten up or you will pay
Fatten up or you will pay
Hunan Uber Alles
Hunan Uber Alles
Uber Alles Hunan
Uber Alles Hunan
Now it is 2034
Clank clank on your skull today
It's the rivet head honey inspection
They've come to see if you're in space or heaven
Bounce quietly by eyore's lamp
Chris Robin's making a perfect camp
Don't worry it's only a BarBeQue
For your limbs here's a whole eggplant
Live on Hunan honey en masse
Cash deal is already done
Go to jail, if you even say boo
Ain't nobody mess with emperor Pooh
Ain't nobody mess with emperor Pooh
Hunan Uber Alles
Hunan Uber Alles
Uber Alles Hunan
