when touring like a bard, and your heart is low
and anger takes control, so emotions can't grow
and we're heading to the same goals, on a long, long road

then love, love will pull us together again
love, love will pull us together again

why's your makeup look so old? you've turned away to cry
are my questions that cruel? our respect runs too high
yet there's still the future that we have to imagine

then love, love will pull us together again
love, love will pull us together again

you cry out in your dreams, all our fantasy's exposed
and there's a desert in my mouth as exasperation takes hold
just that something so right, just never ends for sure

then love, love will pull us together again
love, love will pull us together again
then love, love will pull us together again
love, love will pull us together again
