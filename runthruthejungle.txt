whoa thought it was a nightmare
lord it was so true

they told me don't go walking slow
the devil's on the loose

better run through the jungle(x3)
whoa don't look back to see

thought i heard a toddler
calling to my name

two hundred million arianna grandes
satan cries take aim

better run through the jungle(x3)
whoa don't look back to see

Over on the mountain, chem magic spoke
let the people know my slavery
fill the land with acid gas

better run through the jungle(x3)
whoa don't look back to see
*cuts to the middle of the gas cloud*
skeletal remains of ariannas still standing
flesh melting from the bone
bone corroding and crumbling
thick white clouds spreading wispy, dissipating
fade to black
