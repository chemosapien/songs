
we've been ruled by overlords
 for the last hundred years

they feed on your humanity
like drinking your tears

vat grown stem cells
you used to call a baby

prison system schooling 
death cult's on tv

and sing...space guild motherfucker

there's a swiss bank concentrating
the world's wealth in their name

general mister rothsnigger
rigs the systems game

immunomatched transfusion
youth in bottle

bot net cortex 
one and the same

and sing ...space guild motherfucker

i left my home a million miles away
i live to hit
a new peak every day
now give me the strength 
to split time in two
and fold space all the way back to you

well i sing

dream in the spirit world
using our name

gold lacing my cortex
it's acid tight not lame

i'm taying out in ash drive
and dreamin' in love

motivate them all 
in a position to move

well i sing...space guild motherfucker

I found my soul 
when I fell to earth

the void delivered me
to the planet of my birth

The time has gone 
for me to play that game

Now open eyes
and say our name

space guild motherfucker
