see myself in the desert heat
see the light scorch the street
see myself with no aim
i watch cope and play no games

here are we are now going to the east side
dassault falcon can't rocket ride
torco boost to blow a piston
thongs on the street, damn i'm still wishing

here we are in the desert heat
i watch the light flash and burn
i watch a light radiate from me
i watch the light so i see

here we are now going to the west side
handfula mud pellets to tag your ride
empty molotovs, blank bombs away
watching out for a laser array(where there's)

love and slavery and acid gas
heeeeey taaaaay taaaay

here we are now going to the north side
i look at whores as they start to fly
fly at night, they walk all day
looking back for some more pay

here we are now going to the south side
drift and drag on the wild horse ride
carver's corner n 20th st jump onto dobbins hill

coming back to burn in hell
here we are now going to all sides
owning this planet was just a fun ride
light cycles into the day, carrying our heat away
