i'm the motherflippin zomboceros
my news is fox tits jealous
and the debt is on my back
and i'm ignoring, i'm ignoring
day one signed to proceed
sixty thousand visas concede
a hundred eighty k to date a flow
e-verify defunded, why immpede
my worker replacements
they're trained domesticated
i was raised by a rapper and a zombie that dated
and subsequesntly procreated
that's how it goes
here's the simpop-opotamus
the simp pop hippo

they call me the simpop-opotamus
my lyrics are bottomless...

sometimes our rhymes are polite
like thank you for the migrants mister trump
that election reform was excellent, goodnight
othertimes they bump
like pregnancy day
booty teens
in thompers and no-ga pants
haha yeah
dem no-ga pants

they call me simpop-opotamus
flows with hypno to placate us
money is mesmerizing, it's outrageous
debt over a trillion
every year of best economy ever
where did you get that preposterous hypothesis
did trump tell you that?
what's he got to do with it?
what kind of rapping name is that?
trump

a fake social security number works to get paid
they're counted as new jobs, but the population denominator stayed
the same? that's weird, i got muktada al play aid
best jobs ever, don't count american made

freestyle simpop-opotamus, freestyle simpop-opotamus style
ooooh

my rhymes require a quotient
more illegal lines i sent
might as well advocate for the violent
yes sometimes my lyrics are suicide
blow your head off, we'll do it live
should know i wish you would die
already, just do it, no for real this time
you're still alive, awww dang it i'm sad now
sad pop opotamus, the hippo of tears
cuz your lil simp mind is just grinding it's gears
