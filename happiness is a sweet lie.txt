do you hear me or do you not?
i say one thing, then i'll say another
dropped a line to my opium spot
the flow was harvested, it feels like summer

happiness is a sweet lie
try to fight it, like every night
it dodges to shadows under moonlight
everyday is a lullaby
players owned, like every night
sing it for the babies on my tour life, ah

if she's a zombie whore, then what's the worst
that can happen to a boy who's already dead?
i'm already dead
if she's as bad as they say, then i guess i'm cursed
gazing into her eyes, i think she's still alive
she's still alive

i said 'don't be a bitch, don't call these old tricks'
sitting in my ripped shirt, flooding denial, ooh hoo hoo
i just wanna fuck with you
infinity and divine, not in the butt kind
i just wanna hold your light and rape you too-o-o
i just wanna fuck with you
i just wanna fuck with you

left the crater, flew to the club
i was one form, now i regen to another
crossroads at sunset, good luck
i'll see you there if you think you're tough

happiness is a sweet lie
let's beat it while fucking, I
find myself lost in your eyes, baby
everyday is a lullaby
fly over the lightning
bring it down to earth, i'm lazy 

if she's the devil too, then what's the worst
that can happen to a boy who's already in hell
i'm already in hell
if she's as bad as they say, then i guess i'm cursed
gazing into her eyes, i think she's already in hell
she's already in hell

i said 'just be a whore, i'll remember to try caring'
damning your bitch face, holding a tahoe of tears
i just wanna fuck with you
for this moment and one more time
i just wanna hold your light and rape you too-o-o
i just wanna fuck with you
i just wanna fuck with you

baby, i just wanna fuck (fuck)
with you (fuck)
baby, i just wanna fuck (fuck)
with you
