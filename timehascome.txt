out where the grey disc broke
the lead flowed and the desert spoke
alien wrecks and X ship trials
molten core pedigree

the time has come
take the slave pill
pay your space fare
live up there

how can we dance 
when the world is burning
how do we sleep 
while the void is churning
 
out where our majesty is growing
the radio glowed it's in the air
coal smoldering to the clouds
brood whore army

the time has come
blackholes crack
slavegrid freed
they're heading right back

how can we dance 
when the world is burning
how do we sleep 
while the void is churning
