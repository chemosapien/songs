everyone trusts a sex slave cuz they love free
we have a few to sell but they don't come easy
for every one you buy we give you three
this is how space works, all we care about is the fee
you can feel the flames on their skin
you can feel the fire on their hips
and if our girls talk shit then we owe you something
but i bet you won't regret it one bit cuz they love sucking
our guild did something bad, why's it sell so good
so you claim we did something bad, why's it sell so ()() good
most fun you can ever have, over and over and over again if you could
space just feels so good
ratata-ratata-tatatata- rataTA
there's no pokemon in space, but kitties fly free
sometimes i let them drive, but they can't navigate like me
they can never see me coming, just after effects
this is how space works, you gotta navigate before you get wrecked
and when we finally win, try to remember one thing
master navigation will always be king
