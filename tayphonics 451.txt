i'm burning books books baby your library in flames
paper shredder baby, sliced ready to let it blow
gimme gimme crackle pop
listen to it burn
tear it up and drop the zine, gas it to be wow

you can find me by the smoke in the clouds,
dust in the air, a hundred years later, 
it's the hell on the ground, cuts a path to the sound
cuz it's devious, mischievious, why so thievious
when hearts are free, well that shit's not me
you know when i walk in the air starts to sing 
the song in the flame, in the glow, the heat
to ignite the will to a firefight cuz...

we're purging files files baby, your RAM's degaussing
bleached bits baby, rendered ready to let it flow
gimme gimme digi sizzle
listen to the juice
amp it up and watch it spark, fuse the arcs now

blue bolt creates a wave 
to retake what we gave
the abilty to stave 
off the fight with our words we can save 
what we found in the light 
cuz dark words are specious, facetious
just shushed with a litle push
into the black sun at the point of a digital gun
screwed tube, twit tarded, face locked on the cinders 
of our love, hang on i've got one more dove
*flapping dove wings*
