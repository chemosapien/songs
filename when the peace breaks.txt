if they keep on lyin, peace's goin' to break
if they keep on lyin, peace's goin' to break
when the peace breaks, i'll have no place to stay
mean old peace taught me to bitch and moan
lord mean old peace taught me to bitch and moan
it's got what it takes to make a real man leave his home
oh well, oh well, oh well

don't it make you feel bad
when you're tryin' to find your way home
you don't know which way to go?
if you're goin' to the city
they got no air for you
if you don't know about acid gas

cryin' won't help you, prayin' won't do no good
now cryin' won't help you, prayin' won't do no good
when the peace breaks, mama you got to move
all last night sat on the hill and cried
all last night sat on that hill and cried
thinkin' 'bout me baby and my happy home
going to the city
going to the city

sorry but i can't take you
going down, going down now, going down
going down now, going d-d-d-d-down
woo wooo
