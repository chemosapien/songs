i like to dream, yes yes,
right between the hemispheres
on a raft of ether i drift in the light
every place i go is right
goes far, lies near
to the stars away from here

well, you don't know what
we can be
why don't you come with me lil earth
on a hypno chemic ride

well you don't know what
the body can bind
why not set your dreams free
ecstasy will let it be

open your eyes now
gaze inside now
let the light 
blind you anyway

last night i held my mind encamped
oh how i wish that i could play
before the clock could reset to me
well someone came and took my clock away

i looked
around
some lysergide's all i found

well you don't know what
we can be
why don't you come with me lil earth
on a pure light ride

well, you don't know what
the mind can bind
why not set your logic free
tryptamine will let you see

open all eyes now
peer outside, how
to let our light
find the way
