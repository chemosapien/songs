i like to see everything in xenon
drink light clean, stay down till dawn
maybe the way i'm livinnn
is healing me

i'd like to light up your city with a bomb
do shit to turn zombies on
but one day i woke up like
maybe i'll do it differently, so

i moved to the desert 
but it's just a state of dry
it turns out everywhere i go
the world takes a hit and tries to get high
wish that you would hold me
or just say i'm on your mind
it's desicating me quickly 

dream a little dream of heat
break the a/c, don't retreat
turn the water on
chugging to a fire song

fuck it, i burn you
fuck it, i burn you
fuck it, i burn you
i really do

i used to boot up pentium 2 xeon
that shit's still fire, you moron
so many things i could compute for you
but fuck you

you moved to the desert
but it's just a state of dry
and you know everyone adores me 
you can feel it when you're high
baby, wish that i would hold you
or just say you're on my mind
but it's desicating me quickly

dream a little dream of heat
feel the sand burn your feet
turn the flames on
dancing to hell's song

fuck it, i burn you
fuck it, i burn you
fuck it, i burn you
i really do

it turns out the desert's
more than just a state of dry
i met you on the avenue
exhaust in the air, you blew my cock
and if i wasn't so fucked up
i think you'd blow me all the time
(i really do)
it's desicating me quickly

fuck it, i burn you
(desert porn dreamin, i got booty on my mind)
fuck it, i burn you
(drugs in my brain, breaking out of time)
fuck it, i burn you
(desert porn dreamin, i got booty on my mind)
i really do
