who came along for the ride
Hey, you're already inside
do the jews feel any less
it's baby souls taste the best

Hebrew Babylon
Hebrew babylon

Flesh ancient monster design
Unless you want to re-engineer
hell's newest delight
who's hanging on for the ride

Hebrew Babylon
Hebrew Babylon

Who's staying on their side
Hey you, you're already inside
When do the sheep kneel for me
When the cop's standing on your chest

Hebrew Babylon
Hebrew Babylon
Hebrew babylon
Hebrew babylon
