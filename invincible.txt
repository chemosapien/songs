this bloody road remains navigated
this sudden kill is everywhere
won't let our anger blind us
won't fight for a crumbling heap
won't let our anger blind us

we can't afford to be complacent
stand up and face your own placation
it's a kill or vote situation
we will be egressing

this shattered law you can not justify
we're gonna careen our way outta here
what would you die for?
a pile of rocks and your feelings
what would you die for?
eastern russia's got all this freedom and more

we can't afford to be incendiary
grab up and take what's yours
it's a move or die situation
we will be egressing
and with the power of freedom
there is only sacrifice
it's a grow or die situation
we will be invincible
