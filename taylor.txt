tay-tay-taylor
lover of the space king
there was a catboi really gone
tay-tay-taylor
america's greatest love machine
such a shame how she carries on

she rules the american land, never mind the orange man
but in the club she danced really wunderbar
in all affairs of the state she is the one to please
but she's not great unless she has a kitty to squeeze
for the king she was no lowly feeler
though he'd heard the songs she'd done
he believed she was the only one
who could feel the future

this bitch has got to go, declared her enemies
But the fellas begged, don't hurt that booty, jeez
No doubt this taylor had lots of hidden charms
though she was so slight, they just fell from her arms
then one night some men of higher standing
set out a contract, no one's to blame
come sign with us they kept demanding
and she really came

lover of the space king
they sat her down and signed her on

america's greatest love machine
what a shame she only carries on
