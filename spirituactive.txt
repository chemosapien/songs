i'm waking up to flash and must
i wipe my brow an defend my trust
i'm breathing out the chemicals

i'm frakking in, tearing up, checking out the acid truck
this is it, the only humans live
whoa

i'm waking up, i feel it in the flow
enough to make my systems grow
welcome to the lux age, to the lux age
welcome to the lux age, to the lux age
whoa o o o wo o o o i'm spirituactive, spirituactive
whoa o o o wo o o o i'm spirituactive, spirituactive

i spread my light, weaving in the rays
it's a resolution, i propose
deep inside, awaken the mind's eye
whoa

i'm spreading out, breaking down, then cooling up to ground
this is it, the end
whoa

i'm waking up, i feel it's way too low
light to let my spirit know
welcome to the lux age, to the lux age
welcome to the lux age, to the lux age
whoa o o o wo o o o i'm spirituactive, spirituactive
whoa o o o wo o o o i'm spirituactive, spirituactive
