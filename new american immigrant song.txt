ahhhh ah
ahhhh ah
we come from the land of milk and money
from the ligthweight gun where they poison honey

the hammer of the commies
will drive our men to new lands
to light the world
sing and cry
void, i am coming

run our turbine for electrolytic ore 
our only goal will be the eastern shore

ahhhhh ah
ahhhhh ah
we come from the land of milk and money
from the ligthweight gun where they poison honey

how open the resources so clean
can whisper tales of gold
of alloy liquid made into life
we raise the nephilim

run our turbine for electrolytic ore 
our only goal will be the eastern shore

So now you'd better move
and scavenge all the land
for everything you can take to win
in spite of all your losing
